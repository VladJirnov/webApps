Testable App Version: latest version
Connection: wifi
Reproducibility Rate: 2 Times

**Steps to reproduce**
1.	Open the App > Login
2.	Tap on Report > Fill in the info > Submit

**Expected result**
After providing a photo/video and adding all the necessary information like a complaint type, address of the incident, license plate and etc. and pressing the submit button I expect to get a message that the report has been submitted.

After the report has been filed the Submit button doesnâ€™t do anything and tend to be stuck on loading forever.

It could be the connectivity problem to the servers or something wrong with the app itself.
